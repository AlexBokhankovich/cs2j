                          CS2J Trial Version
                          ==== ===== =======

This archive contains a trial version of CS2J, a converter that
translates C# applications into Java applications. It may be used for
evaluation purposes only.

It has two usage restrictions compared to the full product:

- Java classes are truncated at 150 lines.
- The XML translation files (under NetFrameworks) are signed.  You can
  make modifications, or add new translation files, and these will be
  used by CS2J as long as there are 5 or less translation files
  without valid signatures. If you hit this limit, then just restore
  some of the original translation files and try again.

In this directory you will find:

- README: This file.
- CS2JTranslator: A bin subdirectory contains the cs2j executable and required DLLs.
- NETFramework: XML translation files for a portion of the .NET Framework.
- cs2jlib-src-xxxxxxx.zip: CS2JLibrary is a Java source project. The
  translated Java files will have a dependency on this project. It is
  licensed under the Apache License 2.0, and so there should be no
  problem including it in your application.
- THIRDPARTY-LICENSES: Information about third party software used by CS2J.
- CS2JUserGuide.pdf: A manual for CS2J. 

We hope you have fun evaluating CS2J.  If you have any questions or
comments about CS2J just drop us an email.
